Installing the example solar web application is actually super easy. Here we suppose you already installed the Tomcat sevlet container on your computer TOMCAT_HOME (for example: D:\prog\apache-tomcat-7.0.35). 
If not, you can download it here http://tomcat.apache.org and install it (at TOMCAT_HOME).

The next step is to install Solar:

1    download Solr at: http://lucene.apache.org/solr/
2    extract the solar package into, for example, solr-4.3.0
3    copy the sample “Solr Home” directory solr-4.3.0\example\solr\ (Note that it’s the folder ‘example\solr\’ itself, not the content under it!!!) into the home directory of tomcat: TOMCAT_HOME if you start tomcat with Tomcat Monitor or into TOMCAT_HOME\bin if you start tomcat with TOMCAT_HOME\bin\startup.bat. Note that the solr hoe directory must be put in the right directory. This is very important!!! Otherwise you will get such an exception: “HTTP Status 500 – {msg=SolrCore ‘collection1′ is not available due to init failure: Could not load config for solrconfig.xml …… ”
    In a word, the solr home directory should be put in the Java current working directory. You can also “Configure the servlet container such that a JNDI lookup of “java:comp/env/solr/home” by the Solr webapp will point to the Solr home”.
4    copy the solr war file (solr-N.N.N.war) under solr-4.3.0\dist\ as solr.war into the tomcat webapps directory TOMCAT_HOME/webapps. Tomcat will automatically deploy it.
5    After solr.war is extracted, copy the SLF4j logging jars from solr-4.3.0/example/lib/ext into TOMCAT_HOME/lib or TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/solr/WEB-INF/lib. If this step is ignored, this exception will be thrown out: org.apache.catalina.core.StandardContext filterStart
    SEVERE: Exception starting filter SolrRequestFilter
    org.apache.solr.common.SolrException: Could not find necessary SLF4j logging jars. If using Jetty, the SLF4j logging jars need to go in the jetty lib/ext directory. For other containers, the corresponding directory should be used. For more information, see: http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrLogging

OK. That’s it! Now locate your web browser to http://localhost:8080/solr (Change the port if necessary) and you will see the admin page of solr.

If there are exceptions, check your tomcat logs (such as localhost.YYYY-MM-DD.log) under TOMCAT_HOME\logs\.

PS. actually to install solar on windows is not so much different from that on any other OS. :)
